# 🛡️ SpyEye Security Policy

The SpyEye team and the Delta-Security community take the security of this framework very seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose any vulnerabilities you may find.

## 📈 Supported Versions

Security is a rapidly evolving field, and to ensure the safety of our users, we are only able to provide security support and patches for the **most recent stable version** of the SpyEye framework.

| Version | Supported |
| :--- | :--- |
| **`main` branch (latest)** | :white_check_mark: |
| All previous versions | :x: |

If you are not using the latest version, please upgrade before reporting a vulnerability to ensure it has not already been fixed.

  ✉️ How to Report a Vulnerability
</h2>

**PLEASE DO NOT DISCLOSE VULNERABILITIES PUBLICLY.**

Do **NOT** open a public GitHub Issue for a security vulnerability. This can put other users of the tool at risk.

Instead, we ask that you report all security issues **privately** by emailing our security contact:

### **[contact@delta-sec.site](mailto:contact@delta-sec.site)**

Please use a clear and descriptive subject line, such as "Security Vulnerability in SpyEye C2" or "ESP32 Probe Vulnerability Report".
