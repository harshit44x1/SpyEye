  Is your feature request related to a problem?
</h2>

(A clear and concise description of what the problem is. *Example: "I am frustrated when... because..."*)

*Example: "I am frustrated because I can only serve the default `login.html` or `google_login.html`. I want to add a template for Facebook, but there is no easy way to select it from the config."*

  Describe the solution you'd like
</h2>

(A clear and concise description of what you want to happen.)

*Example: "I would like a new option in the `[CONFIG]` menu or in `config.yaml` (e.g., `portal_settings.template_file`) that allows me to specify which HTML file from the `/templates` directory should be served by the captive portal."*

  Describe alternatives you've considered
</h2>

(A clear and concise description of any alternative solutions or features you've considered.)

*Example: "I considered manually renaming my `facebook_login.html` to `login.html` before running the tool, but this is inefficient and gets overwritten if I pull updates from the repository."*
